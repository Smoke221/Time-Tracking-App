# Tme Tracking


## Day-1

### 1st issue
Signup, login along with github and google auth

as soon as someone logs in we redirect them to homepage/dashboard


in the dashboard we shall display a stopwatch on the right side and a small input box to fill the taskname

on the left of dashboard we shall have a menu with timetrack, projects, users and settings(nothing in this as of now)


a small team chat window in which same team members can chat with themselves 


## Admin Works
Admin/employeer can remove/blacklist users/employees and track their data
